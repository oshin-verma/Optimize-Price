Retail Pricing Strategy Analysis
Project Overview
Briefly explain the project's objective: analyzing retail pricing strategies, comparing store performance to a competitor, and exploring the impact of dynamic pricing based on price elasticity.

Data
Describe the dataset used (Competition_Data.csv). Include the columns and what they represent (e.g., Fiscal Week ID, Store ID, Item ID, Price, Item Quantity, Sales Amount, Competition Price).

Methodology
Outline the steps taken in the analysis:

Data loading and initial exploration (checking for missing values, data types).
Comparative analysis of pricing and sales performance between your store and the competition (histograms, scatter plots, time series).
Calculation and analysis of price elasticity of demand (percentage change over time, regression analysis).
Customer segmentation based on average item price and elasticity.
Simulation of a dynamic pricing strategy based on segment elasticity.
Key Findings
Summarize the main insights from your analysis:

Differences in price distributions and trends between your store and the competition.
Comparison of total sales and sales by price brackets, highlighting areas where the competition performs better.
The overall price elasticity of demand and how it varies over time and across customer segments.
The simulated impact of the dynamic pricing strategy on total sales
